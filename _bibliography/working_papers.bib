title = {The Demographic Impact of Leadership: Mayoral Education and COVID-19 Excess Mortality in Italy},
author = {Mattioli, Francesco and Minello, Alessandra and Nannicini, Tommaso},
abstract = {This paper investigates whether the characteristics of locally elected officials influenced excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data on Italy, one of the first countries to be severely affected, we examine whether mayoral education influenced municipal-level mortality outcomes. We estimate weekly excess mortality using official death statistics and a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model. To address endogeneity in political selection, we implement a close-election Regression Discontinuity Design. We find that college-educated mayors significantly reduced mortality during the first wave of the pandemic, by lowering both the likelihood of excess deaths and the excess mortality rate. These effects are not observed in the second wave, likely due to policy convergence and a stronger role played by national and regional institutions. Our design interprets education as a proxy for broader leadership traits, such as decision-making capacity under uncertainty. The findings underscore that political selection can have real demographic consequences, shaping population outcomes during crises.},

title = {Cultural Values and Contemporary Welfare Provision},
author = {Mattioli, Francesco and Aassve, Arnstein and Macmillan, Ross},
abstract = {The ongoing cultural resurgence in contemporary sociology points to a tension between the types of culture as explanations of social action. In macro-sociology, a key issue is whether the drivers of social dynamics reflect global culture that is procedural in nature, or resemble local nation-based culture that is evaluative and indicative of norms and values. One area where such tensions are inherently problematic is in explanations of social welfare expenditure. While global culture emphasizes and demonstrates similarity of structure and process across countries, welfare expenditure shows wide country variation. Although local culture is an obvious possible source of such variation, there has been no systematic comparative studies of its relevance with credible causal inference. Constructing a unique dataset and using an innovative methodology, this study operationalizes aspects of local culture in terms of values that are defined by trust, gender equality, and familism, which are held up against a measure of global culture. We examine their impact on welfare expenditure for the period 1960 to 2010 by circumventing problems of endogeneity and reverse causality. Our research contributes to the study of culture and values, social welfare differences across countries, and the origins and operations of contemporary nation-state systems.},
