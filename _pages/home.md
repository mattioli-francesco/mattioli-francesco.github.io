I am a PhD candidate at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/phd-social-and-political-science-cohort-2021-22), in the Department of Social and Political Sciences.

My main research interest is in political economy. In my doctoral research I study current topics in political selection, voter participation, and electoral accountability. I also enjoy working at the intersection between political economy, economics of institutions and culture, demography, and health.

Methodologically, I combine causal inference and computational methods to analyze large-scale administrative data, social media and legislative text corpora, survey and experimental data.

My advisors are [Tommaso Nannicini](https://www.tommasonannicini.eu/en/research/), [Vincenzo Galasso](https://www.vincenzogalasso.it), and [Maria Carreri](https://www.mariacarreri.com).

My research has featured in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/23/the-difficulties-of-getting-an-abortion-in-italy), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/us-abortion-laws-worldwide/), and [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2022/9/24/23369572/italy-election-meloni-brothers-of-italy-far-right) among others.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi, and worked at the [Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu) on the ERC-funded project [IFAMID](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/694145).
